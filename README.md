Tech Savvy Blog is a blog for all things tech! This application was created to have a space for tech lovers to read and write about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. With this project, users may create unique accounts with a username, email, and password to create posts or comment on other developers' posts! This application was made using the MVC paradigm, Handlebars.js as the templating engine, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
